# Semantic_analyser
This repository contains the implementation of a lex based semantic analyser capable of parsing the C language.
The functionalities that we have provided are:
1) To detect if the user has used a reserved keyword or identifier as a variable name
2) To check arithmetic expressions (only integers and symbols allowed)
3) To detect if new declarations of fucntions or variables don't conflict with earlier ones.
4) To check if break statements are only present in Loops.
5) Check if a parameter's type is compatible with the function call.

**The test cases along with i/o screenshots are provided in the test_doc.pdf**
